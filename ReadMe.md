# Use Javascript to submit forms on Netlify

### Tell Netlify to expect a form

This can only be done with static HTML (hard-coded, not generated by JS or React). So, we are going to hard-code an "invisible" form into our HTML. This form will be invisible to the user, but will be used to tell Netlify, "Hey, this website has a form, so expect it." Notice how it has the `netlify` tag we've seen so much documentation about.

In your HTML file, where you have your `<div id="root" />` tag, add the following code:

```html
<!-- Tell Netlify to expect this form. Users will not see this form; it has the "hidden" attribute. -->
<form name="contact" netlify netlify-honeypot="bot-field" hidden>
  <input name="name" />
  <input name="email" />
  <input name="message" />
  <textarea name="message"></textarea>
</form>
```

> Note: Any inputs that do not exist here will be stripped out of any form submissions by Netlify. So - make sure the fields you have in your react form also exist in this form.

### Use Javascript to submit the form

Now, completely unrelated to the above form, somewhere in your code base you have a form in react (and the fields of your react form should match the fields in your invisible html form), you can submit the form using javascript. Here is an example onSubmit function

```js
function handleSubmit(e) {
  e.preventDefault();
  setLoading(true);

  // create a URLParamObject
  const params = new URLSearchParams();
  params.append("name", name);
  params.append("email", email);
  params.append("message", message);
  params.append("form-name", "contact"); // the name of your form in Netlify
  const urlEncodedData = params.toString();

  fetch("/", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded", // important! we are not sending JSON, we are sending URL encoded data
    },
    body: urlEncodedData,
  })
    .then((response) => {
      if (response.ok) {
        setShowSuccess(true);
        setLoading(false);
      } else {
        setShowError(true);
        console.error("Form Submission Error:", error);
        setLoading(false);
      }
    })
    .catch((error) => {
      setShowError(true);
      console.error("Form Submission Error:", error);
      setLoading(false);
    });
}
```

### Look in /src/ folder for example.

You can clone this repo and launch it on your own netlify account to test it.
